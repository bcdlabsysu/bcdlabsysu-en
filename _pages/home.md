Brain and Cognitive Development Lab mainly focuses on the cognitive development such as numerical competence, spatial capacities, and logical reasoning among infants, children, adolescents, and adults. For example, we conduct studies to examine whether newborns, who are yet nonverbal, can distinguish small numbers from big numbers; how 2- to 3-year-old children learn counting and spatial reasoning; how these capacities predict children's academic achievement in primary school; how parenting styles impact children's cognitive development; and cognitive developmental similarities and differences among children and adults with different cultural/language background.

We utilize various experimental methods to explore children's cognitive capacities such as conducting behavioral experiments and EEG studies. These studies mainly take place in labotories in Psychology department in Sun Yat-sen University, kindergartens, or medical institutions. Studies are conducted in one-on-one style between experimenter and child.
