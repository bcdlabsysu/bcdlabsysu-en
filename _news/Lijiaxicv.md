RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
Research on the Autistic Preschoolers’ Mathematical Ability  						  2019.08-present
•	From the perspective of promoting the inclusive education of individuals with autism spectrum disorder, I proposed the research idea of quantifying the developmental characteristics of numerical cognition of ASD children with the combination of general cognitive ability. 
•	Responsible for recruiting more than 25 subjects, coordinating test time and venue, handling reimbursement of various expenses; using excel to input and organize experimental data and R language for programming and data processing; independently responsible for the analysis of experimental results and paper writing.

A Meta-Analysis of Mathematical Ability of Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder			  2019.10-present
•	Advanced searching function and professional searching function was conducted in APA Psyclnfo database, and previous researches in related fields were independently collated after reading more than 200 English literatures in detail. Using R language to conduct a meta-analysis of the researches on the mathematical cognitive development of ASD people.
•	Responsible for recruiting more than 25 subjects, coordinating test time and venue, handling reimbursement of various expenses; using excel to input and organize experimental data and R language for programming and data processing; independently responsible for the analysis of experimental results and paper writing.

The Predictability of the Soil Heat Flux based on Fluxnet Station                                       			  2019.10-present
•	The effective prediction of soil heat flux can help better understand the effect of soil heat flux on the climate system and improve the climate simulation. Based on the average daily data of Fluxnet, the statistical analysis and prediction of soil heat flux have been carried out. R language is used to build the equations for predicting the soil heat flux, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, net radiation and Bowen ratio-energy balance. The regression test has been also conducted and the predictability of different soil parameters has been compared. An English thesis with more than 45 pages has been written independently.

Analysis on Precipitation Evolution of North China			 				 2019.04-2019.06
•	Under the background of climate change, the distribution of precipitation in north China and precipitation change would have a big impact on the area of production and living. During the research, Fortran was used to forecast hundreds of millions of rows of precipitation data on the cluster computer. The precipitation evolution map of north China was drawn by Grads. The review part of the research report was written independently.

Research on the Composition and Source of Aerosols with GC-MS Technology and Ion Chromatography         2018.10-2018.12
•	Tangjiawan area, as a typical densely populated area near the sea, can be used as a typical research object for the complex evolution process of urban meteorological pollutants under the background of sea-air interaction. Mainly responsible for the application of test site and temperamental equipment, installation and debugging of atmospheric film sampler, conducting membrane sampling and membrane recovery and dealing with the pretreatment of sampling membrane. Gaussian 09W was used to perform transition state search, structural optimization, virtual frequency calculation and energy barrier calculation for the NO3 cycloaddition reaction.
