A master student in Applied Psychology (class of 2021). I love children and yearn for nature. My research interests are:(1) Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD), such as on Joint Attention Intervention; (2) the Acceptability and Feasibility of Parent-Mediated Intervention for ASD; (3) Core Deficits and Their Potential Cognitive Mechanisms in children with ASD. I plan to systematically study ASD and applied behavior analysis in my master program, hoping to further explore the mechanism of deficits of ASD and explore more effective and practical interventions in order to help people in need.[Click for CV](https://bcdlabsysu.github.io/bcdlabsysu/news/guofangfangcv.md/)

- Email: jiangyy39@mail2.sysu.edu.cn

The research topics that I’m interested in are the mental-mechanism differences between children’s learning mental abacus calculation (MAC) and learning formal mathematical skills; whether MAC learning has positive effect on individual’s ability of mapping symbolic and non-symbolic representations; and whether MAC is an effective intervention for individuals with ADHD. I am also interested in what role gesture plays in the process of math learning and its relevant cognitive mechanisms and the real link between one of the innate non-verbal numerical cognition (i.e., the approximate number system (ANS)) and children’s later math learning. Come and join us!

A master student in Applied Psychology, class of in 2022。I got my Bachelor in Materials Science and Engineering，but got deeply attracted by the inherent power of Psychology.
My research interests ：
1. The development of children's cognitive abilities such as mathematics, logic and thinking；
2. The influence of family educational concepts and methods on children's mathematics learning；
3. The difference in mathematics cognition between normal children and autistic children.
I want to get engaged in children's mathematics teaching and curriculum development in the future， so I am very happy to explore the mystery of children's number cognitive development together with my partners in BCD lab.

My name is Liu Qin. The topic I am focusing on is the cognitive development of children, especially the development and cognitive mechanisms of mathematical ability in early childhood. 
I am doing two research in the field of mathematical development. One mainly uses behavior method to study the number cognitive development among infants, that is, the development trend of number differentiation ability with age; another study looks at the numerical abilities of high-functioning autistic children, and how they are different and similar to typically developing children. The study of symbolic and non-symbolic quantitative representation is a major focus in the field of mathematics. Although the fraction is a major difficulty in education, it has received little attention. I am deeply interested in the relationship between the non-symbolization of fractions and symbolized knowledge and I am working on a related review recently. Due to my growing interest, I would like to continue to do research on children's cognitive development during my graduate study and expand into the field of cognitive neuroscience.
